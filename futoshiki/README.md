# Futoshiki

Furoshiki game with visual clues.

The screen is decomposed in two parts: the main grid, and the side grid.

After selecting a square on the main grid, numbers can be added by clicking
on squares of the side grid.

After selecting the grey square on the side grid, numbers can be highlighted
by clicking on the squares of the side grid.

A single number is colored in red if it is on the same line of an
identical number, on the same column of an identical number, or if it
doesn't satisfy an inequality with a neighbor.
